This is learning based project which I practise WITH MERN(Express, Mongo DB, Mongoose in this repo). The idea of this project was taken from Manuel Lorenz and Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller's Udemy course called [React, NodeJS, Express & MongoDB - The MERN Fullstack Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-nodejs-express-mongodb-the-mern-fullstack-guide/) and followed along with videos and hopefully added some extra features.

The name of project: learning-react-locationsapp-1

Used Language concepts:

1. express
2. body-parser
3. uuid(to create random ids)
4. express-validator

After download project files, in the project directory, you can run :

### `npm start`

# please also add /uploads/images folder to main dir
